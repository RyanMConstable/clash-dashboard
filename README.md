# Clash-Dashboard
This is a project I created for my own personal knowledge. Use it however you would like just note it does utilize your own personal JWT from the clash of clans API.

# Status
CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS!

# Goal
1) Make an easy to setup fully fleshed out clash of clans dashboard with real time texting alerts.

2) Gain more experience with Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Git, Python, FastAPI, and React.

# TO DO
1) Add .env file in root directory for setup for other users and implement it across the board instead of the .env file... use dotenv module in python
